**New to xmr just curious, What are the theoretical outcomes of monero as a currency or as an asset once the block rewards becomes fixed forever. Will it promote it as a more dominant coin in the market? Will there (if there isnt already) be a trend of miners transitioning into xmr because they will always be incentivized, consequently strengthen moneros ecosystem in the long run?**

```
Mining reward is half of what it is now in June 2022. Right now 1.1 XMR is distributed to miners every 2 minutes. 
After June 2022 it will be 0.6XMR every 2 minutes perpetually. Thus miners know what to expect as a return perpetually. 
Meanwhile for Bitcoin the rewards keeps 'halvening' until nothing gets rewarded at all which means miners will 
eventually stop mining Bitcoin which collapses the entire blockchain.
```

**Wouldntt the transaction fees of btc still keep the miners dancing?**
```
What's likely to happen is it gets centralized by most powerful mining entity at the time. A powerful nation state or 
individual group. Whoever dominates the mining, controls Bitcoin. This is why ASIC resistance is so important.
```

**Couldnâ€™t transaction fees alone keep miners afloat if bitcoin price is high enough?**
```
That's the hope. Bitcoin first and foremost tested the theory that you could bootstrap a new kind of money and secure a 
network by distributing digital tokens randomly to people that committed computing power to secure the network. That's 
the magic of bitcoin. Thats why its bitcoin not blockchain.

Bitcoin has not tested the theory that you can secure a network on fees alone. In theory it works.

I find it mind boggling that so many people are willing to bank on this theory just so they can have "muh digital gold" 
with the 21 million hardcap.

I'd trade the guaranteed security of the worlds first freedom money over some notion of deflationary maximalism 
any day, and I have.

I mean, if we go through all the trouble of wresting control of money away from the banks, states, and whoever else 
thinks they should control it, why risk it slipping back into their hands?

What I think is more likely to happen is when the block reward gets low enough, the miners (which have become all 
powerful industry tech giant meganational companies controlling chip fab and energy production) just go "well, we're 
gonna increase the block reward" and the users will go "nah uh, we're not gonna use that chain" and the powerful go 
"well good luck with that, we have all the miners" and the people will go "but....."
